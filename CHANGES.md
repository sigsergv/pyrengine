Released 2023-09-03

Pyrengine is a new site engine for my personal blog. It's very simple but satisfies all my 
requirements.

Pyrengine is based on my previous project Pyrone rewritten in modern flask from ancient pyramid.

Key differences: no more users support except site admin, at least for now. So no registration,
no external logins via external services.
